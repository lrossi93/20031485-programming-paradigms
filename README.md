# UPOBattleship - Programming Paradigms Java project
Java project for the Programming Paradigms course at University of Eastern Piedmont, Vercelli (IT).

# Latest additions/fixes
Uhm, it works fine, pretty much. Check the PDF in "doc" (if you are Italian) or the JavaDOC for documentation.

# TODO
 - [ ] Implement a new `PlayerState` for the start of the game (WATER triggers an unwanted label in `BattlePanel`);
 - [ ] Implement P1vsP2.

# Useful links
 - [Markdown cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) because Lorenzo  _always_  forgets stuff;
 - [Swing Timer](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/misc/timer.html) for game loss condition;
 - [MVC paradigm](https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/javase/application-design-with-mvc.html) to clearly understand how to implement things;
 - [PropertyChangeSupport and PropertyChangeListener](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/javabeans/writing/properties.html#bound) in JavaBeans, because `Observable` and `Observer` are deprecated since Java 9.
